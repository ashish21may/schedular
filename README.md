# Login credentials

1. We fetch the login credentials from UserDetails.json file present in public folder.

2. We have created sample schedular with hardcoded data as mentioned in problem statement.

3. it has create and edit functionality implemented using redux ('react-redux' module) .

4. Navigation is done via 'react-router-dom' module and no other modules used.

5. TO-DO : we may have delete functinality too in project and maybe a sign-up form later if we have data storage available.

6. I have also attached screenshot to help visulaize the navigation and for initial understanding.a


# thank you
